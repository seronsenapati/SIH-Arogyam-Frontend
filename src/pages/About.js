        <SectionTitle>The Science of Ayurveda</SectionTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          Ayurveda, meaning "science of life" in Sanskrit, is one of the world's oldest holistic healing systems. Developed more than 
          3,000 years ago in India, it's based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between mind, body, 
          and spirit. The primary goal of Ayurveda is to promote good health, not fight disease. But treatments may be geared toward 
          specific health problems.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Ayurvedic medicine uses a combination of diet, herbal remedies, exercise, meditation, and lifestyle changes to restore balance 
          in the body. It recognizes that each person is unique and that what works for one person may not work for another.
